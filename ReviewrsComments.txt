- explain the relation between hall and laser data in figure 2 (a)
(done) - increase the font and figure size of figure 2

[Reviewr'c cooments]
- You should correct typo of first line of third paragraph in Introduction section.
  “An superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) is a contactless bearing [3]. it employs an..”
- In figure 2 (a), hall measurement results have almost same values with laser gauge output. Is this a coincidence? You need to explain the relation between hall and laser data.
- I recommend you increase the font and figure size of figure 2 for readability.
