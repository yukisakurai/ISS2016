polarization modulator that requires a continuously rotating optical element, called half-wave plate (HWP), for a cosmic microwave background polarization experiment.The HWP has to operate at the temperature below 10 K, and thus an SMB provides a smooth rotation of the HWP at the cryogenic temperature at about 10K with minimal heat dissipation.In order to understand the potential interference to the cosmological observations due to the vibration of the HWP,it is essential to characterize the vibrational properties of the levitating rotor of the SMB.We constructed a prototype model that consists of an SMB with an array of high temperature superconductors, YBCO, and a permanent magnet ring.The rotor position is monitored by the laser displacement gauge, and the cryogenic Hall sensor via the magnetic field.In this presentation, we present the measurement results of the vibration characteristics using our prototype SMB system.We discuss the spring constant and the magnetic field inhomogeneity of the SMB and sub-components including a rotation frequency monitoring system, a holder mechanism, and drive system.Finally, we discuss the projected performance of this technology toward the use in future space missions.\end{abstract}\section*{Introduction}A cosmic microwave background (CMB) is electromagnetic microwave radiation from the big bang of the universe, and it is observed isotropically in whole sky.One of most important research topics in current cosmology and high-energy physics is to probe the cosmic inflation theory \cite{inflation_sato,inflation_guth},which predicts a rapid expansion of the universe after $\sim 10^{-38}$ seconds from the beginning of the universe.The inflation solves several mysteries of cosmology and it can also becomes a foothold for new physics in high energy physics.The theory predicts that the inflation traces will remain the divergence free pattern in the CMB polarization, so called "B-mode".Therefore, the experimental discovery of the cosmic inflation is possible by the observation of the CMB B-mode polarization.A world-wide keen discovery race is spreading among many CMB polarization experiments.Along with that, the instrumental development has progressed remarkably.One of the most important instruments for precise measurement of the CMB polarization is a "polarization modulator".It consists of an optical element, a Half-Wave Plate (HWP), and a rotational mechanism.After passing through the continuously rotating HWP, the CMB polarization signal is modulated in synchronization with its rotation of a few Hz.Since the intrinsic instrumental noise is not modulated, systematic uncertainties are significantly reduced.On the other hand, the continuously rotating HWP have to be maintained at cryogenic temperature ($\sim$ 10~K) in order to reduce the noise due to its own thermal emission.It is therefore necessary to use a rotational mechanism which allows to rotate with minimal heat dissipation at cryogenic temperature.In general mechanical bearings, there is too much frictional heat due to physical contact, so that a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) \cite{smb} is a good candidate for the rotational mechanism.The SMB is a rotational bearing utilizing magnetic floating by a coupling of a superconductor and a permanent magnet, and thus there is no physical contact.It is possible to achieve minimal heat dissipation at cryogenic temperature with the SMB.The SMB is developed mainly for industries such as flywheel energy storage,although the polarization modulator is one of unique applications and it plays critical role in the CMB polarization experiments.A balloon experiment called EBEX has succeeded the CMB polarization observation with the polarization modulator employing the SMB system \cite{ebex}.Currently, the CMB polarization experiments which consider to implements this system are increasing on the ground and even on the satellites \cite{litebird}.For the polarization modulator, the SMB system has advantages in terms of heat.However, it is also necessary to consider the deviation of the optical axis of the HWP related to the stiffness of the SMB.We evaluate this stiffnes as a spring constant since the dynamics of the electromagnetic force of the SMB system can be analogied as a spring system.In this paper, we describe the result of the vibration measurement of the SMB of 384~mm diameter.Since the typical aperture size of a CMB telescope is 400~mm, so that this diameter (D=384~mm) is close to an actual application.\begin{figure}[htbp]   \centering   \includegraphics[width=70mm]{D400mm.eps}   \caption{The experimental setup for the vibration measurements for $D=384$~mm}   \label{fig:d400}\end{figure}\section*{Experimental Setup}We conducted vibration measurment using a Styro- foam bucket with liquid nitrogen as shown in Figure \ref{fig:d400}.Although the SMB system is operated inside the 4~K cryostat in an actual CMB observation, a liquid nitrogen temperature (77~K) is sufficient for the vibration measurement.We prepare the SMB system with inner diameter of 384~mm.Due to the relatively large diameter, The ring shaped magnet, which consists of 16 segmented NdFeB magnets, are used as the rotor magnet.Each segmented magnet is magnetized axially with the magnetic remnance of 1.24 T.A YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\mathrm{x}}$ (YBCO) superconductor is used as the stator, which is one of High Temperature Superconductors and its transision temperature is $\sim$ 95~K.The YBCO array is formed in a ring shape using three-seeded YBCO tiles.The NdFeB ring magnet and the YBCO array are fabricated by Adelwitz Technologiezentrum GmbH (ATZ) company in Germany \cite{ATZ}.The YBCO array is submerged by the liquid nitrogen but the rotor mganet is exposed to the room environment.We set a space between the rotor magnet and YBCO array with aluminum plates at room temperature enviroment, and then a liquid nitrogen was poured.After the temperature of the YBCO array becomes below its transition temperature, the plates are removed for magnetic levitation.The levitation height, defined as the distance between the bottom of the rotor magnet and the top of the YBCO array, is controled by the tichness of the aluminum plate.We measure the rotor vibration in the axial direction with four different levitation heights (3~mm, 6~mm, 9~mm and 12~mm).The displacement of the rotor is monitored by a laser displacement gauge (keyence LK-500),which is mounted by an aluminum frame jig at a distance of 260 mm from the top of the rotor magnet as shown in Figure \ref{fig:d400}.Since The displacement of the rotor magnet due to the vibration also affects the magnetic field,we also measure the magnetic field by a hall sensor mounted at the top surface of the YBCO array.\section*{Results of the vibration measurement}Figure \ref{fig:vibration_up} shows the laser gauge output and the hall sensor output as a function of time in top and bottom panels,
